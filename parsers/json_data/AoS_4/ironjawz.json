Never stopping for a moment longer than it takes to rip a foe\u2019s guts out with a swipe of their trusty pig-hacka, a Tuskboss rampages across the realms in an endless stampede, trampling all before them into gory paste.",

With a bellow of hate, a Gatebreaker advances on an enemy settlement without fear, shrugging off panicked arrows and cannon fire with little more than a malicious chuckle.\n\nAcross the Prime Innerlands of Shyish, the name Big Drogg Fort-kicka is dreaded. Admittedly, this is as much for the Gatebreaker\u2019s grievous halitosis \u2013 a side effect of eating decomposing corpses \u2013 as his skill at destroying cities. Drogg is known to many undead tyrants, who willingly offer him a portion of their servants to consume in return for his aid. Yet Drogg\u2019s true goal has always been to get close enough to Nagash to clobber him in a show of strength. The Great Necromancer\u2019s shattering at the hands of the Lumineth has set this plan back. Taking this as a personal insult, Drogg has vowed revenge. He eagerly hires his services out to any undead wishing to fight the aelves \u2013 and he has no shortage of clients.",
